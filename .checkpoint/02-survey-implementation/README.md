# Survey Implementation Checkpoint

## Overview
This checkpoint contains the Survey-based TUI implementation before migration to Bubble Tea.

## Files
- `main.go` - Original main file with Survey TUI command
- `internal/tui/prompts.go` - Survey-based interactive prompts
- `internal/kubectl/client.go` - kubectl wrapper functions
- `internal/backup/executor.go` - Backup execution logic

## Complexity Score
- Survey approach: 45 (Acceptable complexity)
- Decision: Migrate to simpler Golden File approach (complexity: 20)

## Timestamp
Created: 2025-07-06

## Reason for Change
- Reducing complexity from 45 to 20
- Moving from Survey prompts to Bubble Tea fullscreen TUI
- Adopting Golden File testing approach
- Starting with single main.go file

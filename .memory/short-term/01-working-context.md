# Working Context

## Current Session Details
- Date: 2025-01-07
- Branch: feature/tui-backup
- Session Start: Continuation - TUI deletion and background mode design

## Recent Git History
- 2cf9850 feat(logger): Integrate structured logging system into CLI
- ed0c296 refactor(core): Remove duplicate code and improve test coverage
- 53ba04e docs: Update roadmap with revised priorities
- fe207ea feat(restore): Implement filesystem restore provider
- 14a0ef2 test: Add mock implementations for Kubernetes interfaces

## Session Progress (Previous)
- Fixed TUI build errors by simplifying UI
- Implemented restore command with TDD
- Created list command for backup metadata
- Integrated metadata saving in BackupAdapter
- Phase 3 init command completed (61.1% test coverage)

## Session Progress (Current)
- **TUI Complete Removal**: Deleted internal/tui/ and related files
- **Dependency Cleanup**: Removed Bubble Tea from go.mod
- **Background Mode Design**: Planning Job domain model with PID tracking
- **File Management Design**: Centralized under ~/.cli-recover/

## Key Decisions This Session
- **TUI Deletion**: Complete removal to maintain hexagonal architecture
- **Background Execution**: Using exec.Command self-re-execution pattern
- **Job Domain Model**: Moving to domain layer with PID tracking
- **File Organization**: All files under ~/.cli-recover/ with cleanup command

## Technical Context
- Go version: Using standard Go with modules
- Key dependencies: Cobra, Kubernetes client-go (Bubble Tea removed)
- Test framework: Testify
- Architecture: Hexagonal (Ports & Adapters) with Provider pattern

## Next Steps
- Complete .memory/.planning/.context/.checkpoint updates
- Implement Job domain model
- Create background execution with PID tracking
- Implement Status command
- Design file management system with cleanup
